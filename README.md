Interactive "flashlight effect" with HTML5 canvas API, and Javascript, launched on github pages

# What it does
When in range of your cursor, the circles bouncing around the window become visible and grow
When they are not in range, they shrink to original size and become the same colour as the background

# To run
Download flash.js and light.html in the same directory and open light.html
